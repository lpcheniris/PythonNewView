<br/><br/><b>The process of making a cup of good tasting coffee couldn't be easier.</b>
<br/><b>Step 1</b>

Bring at least 600 grams (20 oz) of water to a boil.
<br/>
<br/><b>Step 2</b>

Grind 30 grams of coffee (3 tbsp) to a coarseness resembling sea salt. we recommend 23 grams coffee for every 350 grams water.
<br/>
<br/><b>Step 3</b>

No filter paper required.Add the ground coffee to this Dripper and gently tap it to level the surface of the grounds. Place the brewer on a carafe or mug.
<br/>
<br/><b>Step 4</b>

Begin pouring water slowly over the coffee, starting at the outer rim and moving in a steady spiral toward the center of the grounds. Stop pouring when the scale reaches 60 grams. The pour should take about 15 seconds. Give the coffee an additional 30 seconds to drip before moving on to the second pour.
<br/>
<br/><b>Step 5</b>

Starting in the center of the grounds, pour in a steady spiral toward the outer edge and then back toward the center.Add roughly 90 grams, bringing the total to 150 grams. Allow 45¨C65 seconds to elapse.
<br/>
<br/><b>Step 6</b>

As the mixture of water and coffee from the second pour drops to the bottom of the filter, coming close to the level of the grounds, pour an additional 100 grams of water using the same pattern as the second pour. This brings the total up to 250 grams and should take 15¨C20 seconds.
<br/>
<br/><b>Step 7</b>

When the water and coffee from the third pour drops to the bottom of the filter, complete your fourth and final pour. Add 100 grams, bringing the total up to 350 grams of water. This pour should take 20 seconds.Enjoy the final cup.
